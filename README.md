# Members Only

## Description

In this project we created a simple members only system for a club, following the instructions from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication).

This project forms part of the Microverse Rails Technical Curriculum. ![microverse](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3a5835d4f56c57cec85939ac345e43fef164c178/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f4d6963726f76657273652d626c756576696f6c6574)
